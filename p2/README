Title: Project 1: A simple two-dimensional drawing system
Author: Reuben Castelino
Class: ECS 175 - Fall 2017
ID: 999702367

--------------------------------------------------
To compile:
 1. tar -xvf rcasteli_p1.tar
 2. cd rcasteli_p2
 3. make

To run:
  ./rcasteli_p2 test_file_name

--------------------------------------------------
The polygon data file is a basic text file with the following format:

number_of_polygons
polygon1_number_of_vertices
descripton_of_polygon
x1 y1 z1
x2 y2 z2
x3 y3 z3
number of edges
1 2
2 3
1 2
polygon2_number_of_vertices
description_of_polygon
x1 y1 z1
x2 y2 z2
x3 y3 z3
x4 y4 z4
x5 y5 z5
number of edges
1 5
2 4
3 1
2 4

Sample configs are given in the provided code

--------------------------------------------------
The following commands are allowed to interact with the polygons:

Selecting polygons to alter:
  2. You can select them with numbers 1-9
  note: the polygon will turn blue if it's the current polygon

Moving polygons:
  1. You can use the arrow keys to move in the x and y direction
  2. If the polygon is blue, you can also use the "-" and "+"/"=" keys to move it in the z direction

Scaling polygons:
  1. Press "s" to turn on scaling mode for the current polygon
    note: the fill color will turn red
  2. Press "+" (or "=") to scale up by 1.1
  3. Press "-" to scale down by 0.9

Rotating Polygons:
  1. "x" will rotate the polygon around it's centroid in the x direction
  2. "y" will rotate the polygon around it's centroid in the y direction
  3. "z" will rotate the polygon around it's centroid in the z direction
  note: the capital version (X/Y/Z) will rotate it the other way
  4. If you press r, the terminal will prompt you to choose two points and a rotation angle separated by points. For example:
      x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 angleInDegrees
      .5 .5 0 .5 .5 1 30

Quitting and Saving the Polygon:
  1. Pressing the "q" key will save the polygon and exit the program

--------------------------------------------------

Extra coding:
 1. The fourth window (the bottom right pane) is the oblique project with an angle of 45 degrees
 2. I kept rotations around the centroid because i thought they were fun and added the z rotation :)
 3. I implemented Cohen_Sutherland line clipping so that when you scale or translate/rotate out of the unit box, it clips the polygon and keeps part of the line inside the view.
