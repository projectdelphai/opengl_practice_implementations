note:
I thought it was pretty cool :)
  0. untar the file, make the program
  1. run with ./rcasteli_p3 bunny.txt with a light.txt and a materials.txt
  2. press 's' and then '+' a bunch of times to scale the bunny up enough to see the different shadings
  3. then press 's' to turn off scaling and press 'l' to start moving the light around
  4. use the arrow keys and the -/+ key to move the light source around and see the shading change :)

--------------------------------------------------
To compile:
 1. tar -xvf rcasteli_p3.tar
 2. cd rcasteli_p3
 3. make

To run:
  ./rcasteli_p3 test_file_name

--------------------------------------------------
The polygon data file is a basic text file with the following format:

number_of_polygons
descripton_of_polygon
material number
number of vertices
x1 y1 z1
x2 y2 z2
x3 y3 z3
number of triangles
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 3 1

The light file is:
light_x light_y light_z
la la la
li li li
f
k

the material file is:
number of materials
ka ka ka
kd kd kd
ks ks ks
phong number

Sample configs are given in the provided code

--------------------------------------------------
The following commands are allowed to interact with the polygons:

Selecting polygons to alter:
  2. You can select them with numbers 1-9
  note: the polygon will turn blue if it's the current polygon

Moving polygons:
  1. You can use the arrow keys to move in the x and y direction
  2. If the polygon is blue, you can also use the "-" and "+"/"=" keys to move it in the z direction

Scaling polygons:
  1. Press "s" to turn on scaling mode for the current polygon
    note: the fill color will turn red
  2. Press "+" (or "=") to scale up by 1.1
  3. Press "-" to scale down by 0.9
  4. After scaling, press 'b' to recalculate the light modeling

Rotating Polygons:
  1. "x" will rotate the polygon around it's centroid in the x direction
  2. "y" will rotate the polygon around it's centroid in the y direction
  3. "z" will rotate the polygon around it's centroid in the z direction
  note: the capital version (X/Y/Z) will rotate it the other way

Moving the light position:
  1. Press r
  2. Input the light position via:
      x y z
  3. you can also press l and use the arrow keys (and the -/+ keys) to move the light around dynamically

Moving the from position:
  1. press f
  2. input the from position via:
      x y z
  

Quitting and Saving the Polygon:
  1. Pressing the "q" key will exit the program

Extra coding/changes
--------------------------------------------------
  1. I coded the light source to appear so you can get an idea of where it is
  2. You can still transform the polygons and the shading will change based on the new position
  3. You can also dynamically move the light around and see the light move
  4. I optimized the code a little bit so that the bunny isn't as slow as it was in my first iteration. I calculated which triangles are attached to each vertex before i started my transformations so that when you moved the light source, it doesn't ahve to go through all the triangles and find the necessary face normals which made the program too long before

Problems:
--------------------------------------------------
  2. It might be easier to debug by changing the glClearColor to a background of black and to change the pixel size to 2 and the grid_width/height to 500
